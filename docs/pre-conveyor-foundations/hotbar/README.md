# Hotbar

Purpose
- Track selected build item using simple hotkeys.
- Keep this lightweight for the first proof of concept.

Initial constraints
- Hard-coded item catalog is acceptable.
- Number keys can map directly to item types.
- Selection should be visible in debug UI/logging.

Planned artifacts
- `SelectedBuildItem` state/resource
- Hotbar input system (`1..9` selection)
- Optional selected-item visual indicator
