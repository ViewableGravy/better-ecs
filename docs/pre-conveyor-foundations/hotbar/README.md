# Hotbar

Purpose
- Track selected build item using simple hotkeys.
- Keep this lightweight for the first proof of concept.

Initial constraints
- Hard-coded item catalog is acceptable.
- Initial key mapping is key `1` -> `box`.
- Selection should be visible via a tiny on-screen indicator.
- Selected item persistence is not required.
- Clearing selection is allowed.

Planned artifacts
- `SelectedBuildItem` state/resource
- Hotbar input system (initially key `1` only)
- Minimal selected-item visual indicator
