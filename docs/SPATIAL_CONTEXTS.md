# Spatial Contexts Documentation

**Note:** The spatial contexts architecture documentation has been reorganized and expanded.

## New Location

All spatial contexts documentation is now in:
```
docs/architecture/
```

## Start Here

- **Architecture Overview:** [docs/architecture/00-SPATIAL-CONTEXTS-ARCHITECTURE.md](./architecture/00-SPATIAL-CONTEXTS-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Implementation Roadmap:** [docs/architecture/01-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md](./architecture/01-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)
- **Complete Index:** [docs/architecture/README.md](./architecture/README.md)

## What's New

The architecture folder contains:
- Complete architectural specification
- Feature-by-feature implementation guides
- Rendering concepts and cross-engine analysis
- Edge cases and concerns catalog
- Visual editor design
- Persistence system design
- Plugin-based implementation details
